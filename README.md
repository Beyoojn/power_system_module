# Electrical Power System - HTML Project

## Overview

This project provides an HTML-based overview of an electrical power system, including its components, operations, and various analysis methods. It is designed to serve as an educational resource for students, engineers, or anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of electrical power systems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key sections:

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: An introduction to the electrical power system, including a brief overview and navigation to other sections.
- **Components (`components.html`)**: Detailed descriptions of various components of the electrical power system, such as generators, transformers, transmission lines, and distribution networks.
- **System Operations (`operations.html`)**: Information on how electrical power systems operate, including load flow analysis, stability studies, and fault analysis.
- **Analysis Tools (`analysis.html`)**: Descriptions and links to tools or simulations used for analyzing electrical power systems, including ETAP and DIgSILENT.

## Module Structure

- **Fundamental Electrical**: Covers the basic principles and concepts of electrical engineering, including voltage, current, power, and energy.
- **Admittance Matrix**: A representation of the network in terms of admittance (the inverse of impedance) used in power system analysis to solve for voltages and currents in the system.
- **Power Flow**: The study of the flow of electrical power through a power system, typically involving the calculation of voltage magnitudes and angles at different buses.
- **Impedance Matirx**: A matrix that represents the impedances between different points in the electrical network, crucial for fault analysis and system behavior understanding.
- **Etap**: A comprehensive power system analysis tool used for designing, simulating, and optimizing electrical power systems, widely employed in the industry.
- **Protection**: The set of mechanisms and devices designed to detect faults in the power system and isolate the affected areas to prevent damage and maintain stability.
- **Stability**: Refers to the ability of the power system to return to a normal operating condition after a disturbance, such as a fault or sudden change in load.
- **Control**: The techniques and systems used to regulate various parameters of the electrical power system, such as voltage, frequency, and power output.
- **Optimal Power Flow**: The process of optimizing the operation of a power system, ensuring the most economical generation and distribution of electricity while satisfying system constraints.
- **Microgrid**: A localized grid that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main power grid, often incorporating renewable energy sources and providing enhanced reliability.
