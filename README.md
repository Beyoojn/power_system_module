# Electrical Power System - HTML Project

## Overview

This project provides an HTML-based overview of an electrical power system, including its components, operations, and various analysis methods. It is designed to serve as an educational resource for students, engineers, or anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of electrical power systems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key sections:

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: An introduction to the electrical power system, including a brief overview and navigation to other sections.
- **Components (`components.html`)**: Detailed descriptions of various components of the electrical power system, such as generators, transformers, transmission lines, and distribution networks.
- **System Operations (`operations.html`)**: Information on how electrical power systems operate, including load flow analysis, stability studies, and fault analysis.
- **Analysis Tools (`analysis.html`)**: Descriptions and links to tools or simulations used for analyzing electrical power systems, including ETAP and DIgSILENT.
